Projects allow you to keep a collection of files all together, including: 

--

- R scripts

--

- RMarkdown files (more on those soon)

--

- Data files

--

- And much more!


---

## File Types

There are **two main file types** that you'll work with: 

.pull-left[
**R scripts (.R)**

Text is assumed to be executable R code unless you comment it (more on this soon)

```{r}

# This is a comment

data <- read_csv("data.csv")

```
]

--

.pull-right[

**RMarkdown files (.Rmd)**

Text is assumed to be text unless you put it in a code chunk (more on this soon)

![](images/code-chunk.png)



]


---

## R Scripts


Create new script file: File -> New File -> R Script

![](images/new-script.gif)

---


## How to Run Code

Run the code: control + enter on Windows,  command + enter on Mac keystrokes or use Run button

![](images/run-code.gif)

???

Note that you don't have to highlight code. 

You can just hit run anywhere on line to run code. 

---

## Comments

Do them for others, and for your future self. 

```{r eval = F}

# This is a comment

head(data, n = 5)

```

# Packages

---

## Packages

Packages add functionality that is not present in base R. 

They're where much of the power of R is found.

## Packages We'll Use

.pull-left[

.center[
![](images/tidyverse.png)
]

]


.pull-right[

### `tidyverse`

The [`tidyverse`](https://tidyverse.org/) is a collection of packages. 

We'll use [`readr`](https://readr.tidyverse.org/) to import data. 

]

---

## Packages We'll Use



.pull-left[

### `skimr`

[`skimr`](https://github.com/ropensci/skimr) provides easy summary statistics.

]


.pull-right[

]






]

---



## Install Packages

The syntax to install packages is as follows. 

```{r eval=F}
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("skimr")
```

The package name must be in quotes.

--

.dk-highlight-box[
Packages should be installed **once per computer** (i.e. once you've installed a package, you don't need to do it again on the same computer).
]

---

## Load Packages

To load packages, use the following syntax:

```{r eval = T}
library(tidyverse)
library(skimr)
```

Package names don't need to be quoted here (though they can be).

--

.dk-highlight-box[
Packages should be loaded **once per session** (i.e. every time you start working in R, you need to load any packages you want to use). 
]



---



class:inverse

## Your Turn

1. Open the project you downloaded before (it should be on your desktop)

--

1. Open the exercises.R file

--

1. Install the tidyverse and skimr packages using the install.packages function

--

1. Load the tidyverse and skimr packages using the library function

# Import Data



---

## Import Data

Let's read data from a CSV file. 


```{r eval = T, echo = F}

faketucky <- read_csv(here("data", "faketucky.csv"))


```

```{r}

faketucky <- read_csv("data/faketucky.csv")


```

We now have a data frame/tibble called `faketucky` that we can work with in R.



???

- Tibbles are ["modern data frames"](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tibble/vignettes/tibble.html). The main difference for our purposes is that tibbles print much more nicely within R. 

- We'll use the terms tibble and data frame interchangeably. 

- For Excel files, try `read_excel` from the `readxl` package. 

- For SPSS files, try `read_sav` from the `haven` package.


---


## R is Case Sensitive

R is **case sensitive** so choose one of the following for all objects and **be consistent**.
.pull-left[
**Option**

snake_case 

camelCase

periods.in.names
]

--

.pull-right[

**Example**

student_data

studentData

student.data
]




---


## Directories

If the data file is in the working directory, you only need to specify its name.

```{r}
faketucky <- read_csv("faketucky.csv")
```

--

If the data file is not in the working directory, you need to specify full path name. 

--

When specifying the path name use of forward slash (“/”) not backslash (“\”).

```{r}
faketucky <- read_csv("data/faketucky.csv")
```

---

## Where Does our Data Live?

Data we have imported is available in the environment/history pane.

.center[
![](images/rstudio-panes-highlight-environment.png)
]

---
class:inverse

## Your Turn

1. Open the exercises.R file

--

1. Import the faketucky data into a data frame called `faketucky`.

--

1. Make sure you see `faketucky` in your environment/history pane.

## Objects and Functions

> To understand computations in R, two slogans are helpful:

--

> Everything that exists is an **object**, and 

--

> Everything that happens is a **function** call.

# Examine Our Data


---

## Examine Our Data

There are many ways to look at our data. We'll talk about a few.


---

## `faketucky`

If you type the name of your data frame (i.e. `faketucky`), R will output the following: 
```{r}
faketucky
```

--

```{r eval = T, paged.print = F, echo = F}
faketucky
```

---

## `head`

`head` shows us the first X rows. 
```{r}
head(faketucky, 5)
```

--

```{r eval = T, paged.print = F, echo = F}
head(faketucky, 5)
```

---

## `head`

```{r}
head(faketucky, 5)
```

--

.dk-highlight-box[
`faketucky` and the number 5 here are **arguments**.
]

---

## `tail`

`tail` shows us the last X rows. 
```{r}
tail(faketucky, 5)
```

--

```{r eval = T, paged.print = F, echo = F}
tail(faketucky, 5)
```

---

## `View`

`View` (note capital V) opens the RStudio viewer (or click on a data frame in the environment pane).

```{r paged.print = F}
View(faketucky)
```

---



## `skimr`

The skimr package provides more detailed information about our data frame. It is also broken up by the type of variable.

```{r}

skim(faketucky)

```

--

```{r eval = T, paged.print = F, echo = F}

skim(faketucky)

```

---

class:inverse

## Your Turn

1. Open the file exercises.R

--

1. Follow the instructions to use the `head()`, `tail()`, `View()`, and `skim()` functions to examine your data.

---

# We've Got Issues!

---

## We've Got Issues!

Several variables have max values of 999. This seems suspicious!

![](images/missing-data.png)


---

## We've Got Issues!

Several variables show up as numeric, but we know they're **not actually numeric**.


![](images/non-numeric.png)

---

## Let's Import Our Data Again

We need to do two things:



--

1. Tell `read_csv` how to handle **missing data**

--

1. Make sure `read_csv` assigns the correct **data type** to each variable





---


## Missing Data

Here's how we imported our data the first time:

```{r}
faketucky <- read_csv("data/faketucky.csv")
```

--

To tell R which data is missing, simply add an argument to the `read_csv` function as follows:

```{r}
faketucky <- read_csv("data/faketucky.csv",
                     na = "999") #<<
```

```{r eval = T, echo = F}
faketucky <- read_csv(here("data", "faketucky.csv"),
                      na = "999") 

```


---

## Missing Data

If we skim our data again, we'll see that there are no longer 999 values. 

```{r}
skim(faketucky)

```

???

Do this in R





---

## Data Types

When you run `read_csv` you'll see the following message, which tells you the data types that have been assigned to your data frame.

--


```{r}
Parsed with column specification:
cols(
  student_id = col_double(),
  first_high_school_attended = col_character(),
  school_district = col_character(),
  male = col_double(),
  race_ethnicity = col_character(),
  free_and_reduced_lunch = col_double(),
  percent_absent = col_double(),
  gpa = col_double(),
  act_reading_score = col_double(),
  act_math_score = col_double(),
  received_high_school_diploma = col_double(),
  enrolled_in_college = col_double()
)
```

---

## Data Types


- **Double/Numeric** (e.g. 2.5)

--

- **Character** (e.g. "Male")

.small[There are [many other data types in R](https://www.statmethods.net/input/datatypes.html) that we won't discuss in this course.
]

---

## Data Types

```{r eval = T, echo = F}

faketucky <- read_csv(here("data/faketucky.csv"),
                     na = "999",
                     col_types = list(enrolled_in_college = col_character(), 
                                      free_and_reduced_lunch = col_character(), 
                                      male = col_character(),
                                      received_high_school_diploma = col_character())) 


```

```{r}

faketucky <- read_csv("data/faketucky.csv",
                     na = "999",
                     col_types = list(enrolled_in_college = col_character(), #<<
                                      free_and_reduced_lunch = col_character(), #<<
                                      male = col_character(), #<<
                                      received_high_school_diploma = col_character())) #<<


```




---



class:inverse

## Your Turn

1. Open the file exercises.R and change the code so that you correctly import the `faketucky` data frame, telling `read_csv` which data is missing and explictly defining column types where necessary.

--

1. After you make changes to how you import your data, rerun the code in the Examine Data section to make sure everything worked!

# Getting Started With R

One of the main obstacles that many new R users face is simply getting started.

Some users struggle to figure out what the nuts and bolts of getting started: what do you need to download (wait, there’s R and RStudio?), where do you enter code, etc.

Others become overwhelmed, in a classic example of the paradox of choice, with all of the resources available online for learning R. How do you know which approach to using R (and there are many!) is best?

This free Getting Started with R course is designed to get new users, no matter what’s holding you back, up and running quickly. It takes you step-by-step, helping you download exactly what you need to get started.

This course uses a [Tidyverse-centric approach](http://varianceexplained.org/r/teach-tidyverse/) that makes the learning process much easier (it’s also [favored by experienced users](https://twitter.com/rfortherest/status/1095375761660395520)).
